## What is Old Faithful?

Old Faithful is a geyser in Yellowstone National Park in the U.S. It erupts periodically. See [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Faithful)

It can shoot 14,000 to 32,000 liters of boiling water to a height of 30-55 meters. It is an impressive sight!

## Predicting Wait Time During Eruptions

The duration of each eruption and wait time between eruptions has been observed and recorded. One dataset was created with 272 observations. There seems to be a relationship between the duration of an eruption and how long you have to wait for the next one.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height=400, out.width=400}
require(stats); require(graphics);
f.tit <-  "faithful data: Eruptions of Old Faithful"
plot(faithful$eruptions, faithful$waiting, main = f.tit,
     xlab = "Eruption time (min)",
     ylab = "Waiting time to next eruption (min)")
fit <- lm(waiting ~ eruptions, faithful)
      abline(fit, col="red")
```
The red line indicates a simple regression.

## Regression Analysis Summary
```{r, }
summary(fit)
```
The p-value is well under 0.05

## Predicting

We now have a simple prediction model. So, for any input we can predict what will the wait be for the next eruption.
```{r}
erupt<- 5 #Assume last eruption was 5 minutes long 
wait <- fit$coeff[1] + erupt * fit$coeff[2]
paste("Expected time to next eruption is", round(wait, 0), "minutes.")
```
